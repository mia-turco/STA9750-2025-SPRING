<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This document presents an analysis of three proposed policies aimed at improving NYC payroll management. The goal is to assess the financial implications and recommend whether these policies should be adopted.</p>

<h1>Background on NYC Payroll Structure</h1>
<p>Before diving into the policy analysis, it’s important to understand the structure of the payroll system in New York City. The payroll system of New York City is vast and complex and involves hundreds of thousands of employees in different agencies. Salaries are a function of union contracts, job classifications and length of service; but, overtime and pensions are paid on top of the basic salary to increase the overall cost. Some agencies, however, rely more on overtime because of staffing shortages, which increase spending. However, some high ranking employees earn more than the mayor and this has caused some concerns with regard to salary structures. Managing to give pay that is fair while also staying within a budget is a daily task and, therefore, payroll policies are central to cost saving efforts.</p>

<h1>Limitations &amp; Assumptions</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Data Accuracy:</strong> This analysis assumes that the payroll dataset is comprehensive and accurate. Missing or mistyped data can lead to wrong conclusions.</li>
<li><strong>Employee Behavior:</strong> We assume that employees whose salary or overtime is capped will not try to increase their pay in other ways, for example, by changing their job titles.</li>
<li><strong>Feasibility of Hiring:</strong> The analysis assumes that it is feasible to hire additional employees to work in place of overtime and that it is possible to fill the positions quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Fixed Work Hours:</strong> The premise that 2000 hours of work per year is a full time workload and 200 hours is a reasonable cap may not be consistent with actual labor agreements.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Realities:</strong> The possible savings calculations do not take into account the expenses that come with hiring and onboarding new employees.</li>
</ol>
<p>#Conclusion Each of these policies has potential savings and implementation feasibility trade-offs. The CATS Commission should consider a phased approach to introducing salary caps and overtime reductions, while making sure that staffing levels do not decrease to a point where the levels of city services are compromised.</p>
