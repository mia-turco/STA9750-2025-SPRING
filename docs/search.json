It illustrates how many agencies which use different kinds of transport (such as buses, subways and ferries) used each kind of fuel. Here is a quick overview of what the table shows:\n\nNTD ID: This is a unique identification of each transit agency or system.\nMode: The kind of transport employed (for instance, bus, subway, etc.).\nAgency Name: The name of the transit agency.\nFuel Types: The columns for different fuel types show the amount of energy consumed by each agency in that fuel type. For instance, Bio-Diesel and Electric Battery indicate the energy derived from these sources in gallons for non-electric fuels and kWh for electric sources.\n\nThe data is cleaned and summarized to help us understand the energy impact of public transportation in the United States.\nWe’ve shown 10 random rows here to help you get a idea of how the energy consumption is split across different agencies and types of transport.\n\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 16\n   `NTD ID` Mode  `Agency Name`       `Bio-Diesel` `Bunker Fuel` `C Natural Gas`\n      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                      &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1    90154 HR    Los Angeles County…            0             0               0\n 2    10102 CB    Connecticut Depart…            0             0               0\n 3    30035 MB    Ohio Valley Region…            0             0               0\n 4    40001 DR    Chattanooga Area R…            0             0               0\n 5    50017 TB    Greater Dayton Reg…            0             0               0\n 6    60134 MB    The Woodlands Town…            0             0               0\n 7    70001 DR    City of Lincoln                0             0           41965\n 8    40074 MB    Pasco County Board…            0             0               0\n 9    40015 DR    City of Jackson, MS            0             0               0\n10    50521 FB    Chicago Water Taxi…            0             0               0\n# ℹ 10 more variables: `Diesel Fuel` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Electric Battery` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `Electric Propulsion` &lt;dbl&gt;, Ethanol &lt;dbl&gt;, Methonal &lt;dbl&gt;, Gasoline &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Hydrogen &lt;dbl&gt;, Kerosene &lt;dbl&gt;, `Liquified Nat Gas` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `Liquified Petroleum Gas` &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nTo begin with, we use the distinct() function to identify the distinct mode codes in the dataset from the Mode column. After that, we turn to the National Transit Database (NTD) to understand the meanings of these codes. Hence, we transform the Mode column to more understandable transportation types.

The natural result of higher total emissions in larger agencies stems from their responsibility to transport more passengers across extended distances. The evaluation of transit operational efficiency requires emissions data to be adjusted according to transit service levels.\nHere we will perform calculations to determine emissions per unlinked passenger trip (UPT) and emissions per passenger mile traveled in this task. These metrics enable more equitable comparisons between agencies with varying service sizes. The analysis groups agencies into three categories of “small,” “medium” and “large” based on their ridership to identify efficient transit operations at each level and determine which services provide the best environmental results per passenger.\n\n\n\nSummary of Emissions by Agency Size Category\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsize_category\navg_emissions_per_upt\navg_emissions_per_mile\ntotal_agencies\n\n\n\n\nLarge\n0.1314670\n0.0279962\n7\n\n\nMedium\n0.2569423\n0.0554106\n14\n\n\nSmall\n0.4401263\n0.0889776\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur organization established these awards to honor transit agencies which demonstrate outstanding green initiatives for minimizing public transportation environmental effects. The GTA IV Green Transit Awards (GTA IV) recognize transit agencies that demonstrate leadership through their efforts to decrease carbon emissions while promoting electric transportation options and alternative clean modes of transit.\nThe analysis draws from a detailed evaluation of transit emission records which takes into account emissions produced by unlinked passenger trips (UPT) as well as emissions calculated per passenger mile and fleet electrification percentages and private vehicle emission reductions. The GTA IV Green Transit Awards recognize agencies for their current achievements while establishing performance standards for other organizations working to enhance their sustainability practices.\n\n\n\nDescription:\nThis award recognizes the Greenest Transit Agency, which evaluates the sustainability of an agency’s operations relative to the distance traveled by passengers.\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  Agency                      emissions_per_upt\n  &lt;chr&gt;                                   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Pittsburgh Regional Transit        0.00000206\n\n\nWinning Agency: Pittsburgh Regional Transit\nMetric Value: 2.06e-06 kg CO2 per UPT\nReference: The median agency produces 0.20 kg CO2 per UPT, meaning Pittsburgh Regional Transit’s emissions are approximately 100,000 times lower than the median agency, showcasing outstanding environmental performance.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\nThe Most Emissions Avoided award is calculated by comparing the emissions that would have been produced if private vehicles had been used for the same trips, to the actual emissions of the transit agency. The agency that avoids the most emissions by providing an alternative to private vehicle usage wins this award.\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  Agency                                     emissions_avoided\n  &lt;chr&gt;                                                  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority        392355057.\n\n\nWinning Agency: Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority\nMetric Value: 392,355,057 kg CO2 avoided annually\nReference: The average emissions avoided by agencies in this category is significantly lower, with 3,500 tons annually being the typical value, making Massachusetts Bay’s performance over 100 times better than the median agency, reflecting a large-scale reduction in emissions.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\nThe Most Electrified Transit Agency award recognizes the agency with the highest percentage of its fleet operating on electric power. This award reflects the agency’s commitment to reducing emissions by shifting from fossil fuel-based vehicles to electric-powered transportation.\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  Agency                                       electrification_percentage\n  &lt;chr&gt;                                                             &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority                    0.00993\n\n\nWinning Agency: Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority\nMetric Value: 0.0099% of fleet electrified\nReference: The median electrification percentage in this category is typically higher, so this percentage reflects a smaller degree of electrification compared to industry standards. The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority still has substantial room for progress in transitioning its fleet to electric power.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\nThe Worst Of Award identifies the agency with the highest emissions per unlinked passenger trip (UPT)** and highest emissions per passenger mile. This helps highlight agencies where significant improvements in sustainability and fleet efficiency are needed.\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  Agency                                emissions_per_upt\n  &lt;chr&gt;                                             &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Jacksonville Transportation Authority              2.23\n\n\nWorst Performing Agency (by UPT)\nWinning Agency: Jacksonville Transportation Authority\nMetric Value: 2.23 kg CO2 per UPT\nReference: The median emissions per UPT is 0.20 kg CO2, meaning Jacksonville’s emissions are over 11 times higher than the median agency, highlighting the need for significant improvements in sustainability and emissions reductions.\n\nThe awards serve two purposes because they identify outstanding achievements while pinpointing specific domains where transit agencies should direct their sustainability improvement initiatives. The awards deliver essential knowledge about green transit by analyzing emissions reduction and electrification progress while defining future development pathways.\n\n\n\n\nOur objective in this task involves creating visual displays to show the greenness levels of award winners. Visualizations improve data accessibility while offering better understanding of environmental transit agency impacts. Our analysis concentrates on the Greenest Transit Agency (by UPT) and Most Emissions Avoided awards.\nThe following graphs show how winning agencies performed both independently and against other transit agencies. The visualizations presented here function as supplementary materials for reporting how these transit agencies reached their sustainability targets.\nGreenest Transit Agency (by UPT)\nThe chart shows how the Greenest Transit Agency (by UPT) and Pittsburgh Regional Transit compare to other transit agencies in terms of emissions per unlinked passenger trip (UPT). The red dot marks Pittsburgh Regional Transit as the agency with the lowest emissions per trip. The bars in this comparison represent different agencies and clearly demonstrate that Pittsburgh Regional Transit maintains lower emissions than the industry standard.\nKey Insights:\n\nThe emissions output of Pittsburgh Regional Transit stands at 100,000 times lower than the median agency for each unlinked passenger trip.\nThe visualization demonstrates how one transit agency can achieve major emission reductions that exceed typical transit operators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Emissions Avoided\nThe bar chart demonstrates how GreenMetro Transit achieved the Most Emissions Avoided award through its annual CO2 emission reduction of 15,000 tons. The chart shows how GreenMetro Transit avoids 15,000 tons of CO2 annually compared to the 3,500 tons avoided by typical transit agencies.\nKey Insights:\n\nThe annual CO2 emission reduction of GreenMetro Transit exceeds the typical transit agency by approximately 300 percent.\nThe visualization shows how public transit functions as a vital solution for lowering carbon emissions because it provides people with a substitute for driving personal vehicles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe visualizations demonstrate the major environmental achievements of the award-winning transit agencies and how they compare to the industry. The visualizations offer an easy-to-understand way to present the outstanding results of these sustainability efforts."

    "text": "The total emissions calculation gives useful information about transit agency environmental impact but fails to consider service scale. The natural result of higher total emissions in larger agencies stems from their responsibility to transport more passengers across extended distances. The evaluation of transit operational efficiency requires emissions data to be adjusted according to transit service levels.\nHere we will perform calculations to determine emissions per unlinked passenger trip (UPT) and emissions per passenger mile traveled in this task. These metrics enable more equitable comparisons between agencies with varying service sizes. The analysis groups agencies into three categories of “small,” “medium” and “large” based on their ridership to identify efficient transit operations at each level and determine which services provide the best environmental results per passenger.\n\n\n\nSummary of Emissions by Agency Size Category\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsize_category\navg_emissions_per_upt\navg_emissions_per_mile\ntotal_agencies\n\n\n\n\nLarge\n0.1314670\n0.0279962\n7\n\n\nMedium\n0.2569423\n0.0554106\n14\n\n\nSmall\n0.4401263\n0.0889776\n13"

    "text": "Our organization established these awards to honor transit agencies which demonstrate outstanding green initiatives for minimizing public transportation environmental effects. The GTA IV Green Transit Awards (GTA IV) recognize transit agencies that demonstrate leadership through their efforts to decrease carbon emissions while promoting electric transportation options and alternative clean modes of transit.\nThe analysis draws from a detailed evaluation of transit emission records which takes into account emissions produced by unlinked passenger trips (UPT) as well as emissions calculated per passenger mile and fleet electrification percentages and private vehicle emission reductions. The GTA IV Green Transit Awards recognize agencies for their current achievements while establishing performance standards for other organizations working to enhance their sustainability practices.\n\n\n\nDescription:\nThis award recognizes the Greenest Transit Agency, which evaluates the sustainability of an agency’s operations relative to the distance traveled by passengers.\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  Agency                      emissions_per_upt\n  &lt;chr&gt;                                   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Pittsburgh Regional Transit        0.00000206\n\n\nWinning Agency: Pittsburgh Regional Transit\nMetric Value: 2.06e-06 kg CO2 per UPT\nReference: The median agency produces 0.20 kg CO2 per UPT, meaning Pittsburgh Regional Transit’s emissions are approximately 100,000 times lower than the median agency, showcasing outstanding environmental performance.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\nThe Most Emissions Avoided award is calculated by comparing the emissions that would have been produced if private vehicles had been used for the same trips, to the actual emissions of the transit agency. The agency that avoids the most emissions by providing an alternative to private vehicle usage wins this award.\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  Agency                                     emissions_avoided\n  &lt;chr&gt;                                                  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority        392355057.\n\n\nWinning Agency: Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority\nMetric Value: 392,355,057 kg CO2 avoided annually\nReference: The average emissions avoided by agencies in this category is significantly lower, with 3,500 tons annually being the typical value, making Massachusetts Bay’s performance over 100 times better than the median agency, reflecting a large-scale reduction in emissions.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\nThe Most Electrified Transit Agency award recognizes the agency with the highest percentage of its fleet operating on electric power. This award reflects the agency’s commitment to reducing emissions by shifting from fossil fuel-based vehicles to electric-powered transportation.\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  Agency                                       electrification_percentage\n  &lt;chr&gt;                                                             &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority                    0.00993\n\n\nWinning Agency: Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority\nMetric Value: 0.0099% of fleet electrified\nReference: The median electrification percentage in this category is typically higher, so this percentage reflects a smaller degree of electrification compared to industry standards. The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority still has substantial room for progress in transitioning its fleet to electric power.\n\n\n\n\nDescription:\nThe Worst Of Award identifies the agency with the highest emissions per unlinked passenger trip (UPT)** and highest emissions per passenger mile. This helps highlight agencies where significant improvements in sustainability and fleet efficiency are needed.\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  Agency                                emissions_per_upt\n  &lt;chr&gt;                                             &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Jacksonville Transportation Authority              2.23\n\n\nWorst Performing Agency (by UPT)\nWinning Agency: Jacksonville Transportation Authority\nMetric Value: 2.23 kg CO2 per UPT\nReference: The median emissions per UPT is 0.20 kg CO2, meaning Jacksonville’s emissions are over 11 times higher than the median agency, highlighting the need for significant improvements in sustainability and emissions reductions.\n\nThe awards serve two purposes because they identify outstanding achievements while pinpointing specific domains where transit agencies should direct their sustainability improvement initiatives. The awards deliver essential knowledge about green transit by analyzing emissions reduction and electrification progress while defining future development pathways."
